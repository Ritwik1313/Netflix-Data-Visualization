A Data Visualization Project by Ricky Hota

The Streaming Genre Explorer is a lightweight, interactive data visualization tool built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Chart.js. It allows users to explore how viewing time across genres changes by region and year using a clean, Netflix-inspired interface.

This project was created to showcase skills in front-end development, data visualization, UI design, and interactive data storytelling.
