🎬 Streaming Genre Explorer

A Data Visualization Experience by Ricky Hota

The Streaming Genre Explorer is an immersive, interactive data visualization experience designed to demonstrate how storytelling, design, and engineering can work together to transform raw numbers into insight. Built entirely with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Chart.js, this project recreates a Netflix-inspired environment where viewers can explore how global audiences spend their time across genres, regions, and years.

Far more than a simple bar chart, this project showcases a complete approach to visualization engineering: sleek UI, dynamic animations, responsive design, real-time interactions, and narrative-driven insights. Every detail—from hover elevation on cards, to theme-accurate colors, to algorithmic breakdowns of viewing share—was crafted to simulate the type of high-polish user experience expected at modern streaming and entertainment companies.

This project highlights my strengths in:

Front-end engineering (DOM manipulation, modern UI patterns, state updates)

Data visualization engineering (Chart.js configuration, custom tooltips, animations)

Data storytelling (auto-generated narrative summaries that adapt to user input)

Interface design & UX thinking (clear hierarchy, responsive layout, Netflix-inspired palette)

Rapid prototyping & product iteration (building a complete interactive tool within hours)

The result is a compact but powerful demo that turns a synthetic dataset into a rich browsing experience, which definitively illustrates how careful engineering and thoughtful visualization can make data intuitive, entertaining, and instantly explorable.
